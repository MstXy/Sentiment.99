I have a very close relationship with Mary and consider her my own, so much so that she is one of the only people I trust to help me out in the garage, like I used to with my dad when I was little.\n\nMary is a beautiful and smart girl who will be attending college in the autumn. The problem is that Mary’s birthday is also coming up around that time, so the wife and I have agreed to buy her a car and pay her insurance. Well I thought we were buying her a car, until Mary came up to me thanking me for giving her my late fathers car and then hugged, I was very confused at this point and didn’t know what to say so I just hugged her back and let her know how much I loved her and how proud of her I was. I asked her who told her, and she said mom.\n\nI asked my wife why she thought telling Mary she can have the car was a good idea and she replied that she knew Mary liked the car and we were going to buy her a car anyway so why not just give her one of the cars no one drives. I told her that the car belonged to my dad and I don’t want to give it to away as its very close to my heart and special to me, she said it would be nice and mean a lot to Mary if she got the car as it would show her how much she means to me. I got kind of mad that she said that me giving her the car would show how much she means to me and asked her what about the last 12 years, don’t they mean anything. She said that I was taking it the wrong way and we’d continue this conversation when I calm down. I felt she wasn’t respecting my attachment to the car and so I (very immaturely) asked her who she thinks she is wanting to give my stuff away. \n\nWe both later apologised, and we’re good again now, she maintains (and I know) giving the car away is the right thing to do.

My mom sent a picture of her wedding gift directly to me, and called right after. It seemed weird, so i asked \"why are you sending it directly to me and not in the family group chat?\" as everyone in the family always does. It also dawned on me that nobody mentioned anything about the wedding in the group chat. Hm. Weird. She stutters and eventually confesses everyone in the whole family is invited to the wedding. Even my aunt whom they never talk to, and don't live close to us. It's not as small as it seemed.\n\nSo why is she sending it directly to me? Because everybody, every single person in my family, agreed to keep silent about the wedding. \"Because I would get mad i was the only one not invited\", which is a direct quote from my aunt. I don't get along with my brother, so not getting invited is fine. What hurts is everybody lying to me. Flat to my face, even whenever i asked about the wedding in the past weeks. My mom confessed she told me because she didn't want me to see the happy wedding family pictures with everyone in it, except me.\n\nI feel deceived, lied to, and honestly disgusted. My whole family is lying to me. I get really mad at my mom, i explain how i feel, but i get no further explanations or apology or what. She starts doing what she always does, saying things like \"don't get mad at me, i can't take you being mad at me.\". The guilt tripping starts, she plays the victim. It's nothing new, so i avoid her texts.\n\nThen my twin-sister starts texting. She calls me sick in the head that i get mad over this. I replied, explaining very clearly that i'm just mad about the lying and deceit. She calls me sad and pathetic, says it's really low to kick up a fuss about the situation. How can i do this to our mother. Etc. After some 20 to 30 really aggressive texts (without me replying or reading at all), i was called cruel, disgusting, crazy, and a \"stupid bitch\".

I will be getting married at a temple where people belonging to other faiths aren't allowed inside. | This all might sound really weird and alien to the people of this sub reddit, but hear me out. \n\nI'm engaged to be married to my fiance, who comes from a royal Indian (Hindu) lineage. His great grandparents were from a princely state in Colonial India, during British rule. \n\nAfter India gained independence, the government abolished all princely titles, and the former Royal families became regular citizens. \n\nHowever, these families have retained their wealth and popular support and the people from their town still see them as their Royal family. In short, they are influential people. \n\nI didn't know about my fiance's background for years, and upon finding out, I even broke up with him because I was intimidated.\n\nAnyway, So I'm half Indian, born to a British father and my Indian Hindu mother. They divorced when I was 5, and I primarily grew up with my mother. My mother married my stepdad when I was 8, and I had a very Hindu religious upbringing. \n\nI saw my father only a few times a year, but we had a good time together whenever we were together with his family. \n\nNow since my fiance belongs to a very religious Hindu family, I had to formally become a Hindu and get adopted by my stepdad as I am a non-hindu by birth. \n\nThis was necessary because the temple where I would be getting married at, doesn't allow entry for non hindus. And the ceremony requires both the bride and the groom to be hindus. \n\nNow because I would be getting married at the temple, with only a select few family and friends present (They all have to be Hindu), it wouldn't make sense for me to invite my dad for the ceremony. \nAnd because my stepdad would be the one giving me away (there's a ritual where the father of the bride gives away the bride, known as kanyadaan), I just thought there was no point of inviting him. \n\nI will be inviting him for the reception though, which will be a party for extended family and friends. \n\nWhen my father asked me about the actual wedding, I told him why I couldn't invite him. He was furious about the fact that I let my stepdad adopt me for the ceremony.

He said he was too busy to talk and asked if I was freaking out about \"nonsense\" again. I told him this was about what he said to my nephew. He said to stay out of he and his kids business and he wasn't even comfortable with me driving the kid and would talk to my sister about it. I stormed out and thought about what I should do. \n\nSo the next morning I went directly to the kids principal and told her what I'd heard. She profusely thanked me and said she would address the issue. I was very happy that at least some sort off authority figure knew. \n\nLater in the day I got a text from niece saying \"Aunt Shana, what did you tell the principal?\" I told her that was adult stuff. She texted back \"My dad never said we should do drugs!\" I told her \"honey, let the adults handle this ok.\" Her response was \"he told us that he doesn't care if we do drugs like smoke pot but he wants us to realize that if we do drugs, we have to get them from drug dealers who can be really awful people!

I’m a relatively fit person at 6’1” 180 lbs.

I said I’m just concerned for her. She said she’s sick of people like me who keep making a big deal out of how she eats. Her mom apologized for her and thanked me for worrying about her health, but that Marika can handle herself well. I said that’s great and that was pretty much the end of that discussion. Marika seemed kind of cranky, especially with me. She was on her phone nearly the whole time while the rest of us caught up.

When she said that wasn't good enough I said \"because I just don't want a white dress and I think coloured dresses look nicer and it's my wedding so I get to pick my clothes\".\n\nMum asked a few more times what the real reason was and I eventually admitted that her being the only woman to break the tradition and also the only woman to get divorced didn't exactly instill me with confidence in white dresses.

I ask my wife about it and she says she asked for the takeaway cup for both our drinks bc it would be easier for us to drink from them while looking after the dog. I get a bit annoyed at this, since she clearly said OK when I called her before, and when I tell her this, she says that she couldn’t hear well in the cafe and assumed I was just asking for my regular coffee order. Still annoyed, I tell her that she could’ve just asked again if she didn’t hear clearly the first time, and she gets annoyed and says that I can go ask for the other cup if I want.\n\nA few minutes later, wife asks me to move my chair a bit so the dog can lie down if he wants. Half jokingly, I say OK but don’t move my chair. She asks again a few seconds later, and I do the same thing again. Son catches on to what I’m doing and says something along the lines of “can you just move your chair so Parker (our dog) can have more room?”. Everyone seems really annoyed by what I meant as sort of a joke, and I get bit annoyed at myself for having soured the mood, but this also kind of caught me off guard and I sprung into full defensive mode for my stance in our disagreement earlier, casually mentioning this time my sister’s son had to go to the emergency room because the school served him peanuts, despite her informing them beforehand of his allergy. Again, this was sort of meant in jest and I sarcastically said that this story just popped in my head, denying any relevance to to whole coffee cup thing. After this we just sort of finished eating in silence and went back home.\n\nI guess I see how my behaviour could have been seen as a bit petty and I wish wouldn’t have let such a small problem ruin our brunch, but I’m also annoyed at how seriously everyone reacted to my joke and still stand by my point that my wife could have asked me to repeat what I said if she didn’t hear clearly the first time - so turning now to this sub, AITA?","label":1},{"sentiment":0.9997374415397644,"input":"AITA for telling my mom not to touch my things? | Not sure how to start this off. \n\nMy mom and I dont have a good relationship at all, ever since I've moved in with my boyfriend it's gotten better.

She's had complications with her menstrual cycle and often complains that doctors tell her to lose weight to help conceive. Her rationalization is that since her much smaller (by ~100+ lbs) sister gets pregnant at the drop of a hat, she should be able to as well. They're half sisters. She's been trying to conceive for almost a year and it's not been fruitful.\n\nI'm getting more and more anxious for her as time goes by and made the mistake of saying that maybe she should take her doctors, multiple, advice but she just doubled down on her position. I don't know how to be supportive in a way that isn't superficial without bringing to light that part of her complications may be from being morbidly obese.

So, here goes: (Thanks in advance for your comments and candor.)\n\nMy parents are going to retire in the next two years and my Mom used to joke about moving to a retirement community at least six states away -- it would take a 2.5 hour plane flight to go there. Recently, she and my Dad took a trip down there to \"explore the possibilities\". When they got back it turned out that they bought a plot of land at a particular development and were very excited to tell me and my brother.\n\nMy brother said one positive sentence about how he is happy that they are happy. I tend to be more critical about everything and so I ask them what made them want to move to the retirement community.\n\nMy mother tells me that she really wants to be part of a community, but I counter that in our hometown, which has a very active PTA, Boy/Girl Scout Groups, Parents who Chaperone Field Trips, Religious Center Sisterhoods, etc. she never took the initiative to be part of those groups. She responds that this is because she was the primary breadwinner and worked hard to give us a good life (completely true), but my caveat is that if people really want something, they make it happen.\n\nMy father tells me that he really wants to get back in shape, but whenever Mom or I invite him to join us on a 3 mile walk, he backs out because that would wind him. I point out that if he can't do that minimal level of exercise here, why does he think the retirement community would be better. He doesn't have an answer.\n\nConsidering that I have found my parents reasons wanting and they have not realized how connected they are to the family and friendship networks that we have in our hometown, I have remained critical of the move. My parents are irked that I continue to not support their decision as they have started to build their house in the retirement community.\n\nWhen their friends and our family ask me how I feel about this change, I give my honest opinion as I have here in this thread and that bothers them, too. They have told me to keep my opinions to myself and be dishonest about how I feel about their upcoming move when talking outside of our immediate family. They have also insinuated that some of this may come from a fear of them \"abandoning me\", but after serious introspection (because it could be a possibility), I have concluded that this is not the source of the problem, but the specific considerations I outlined (1) that their reasons for moving do not match their historical preferences and (2) that they undervalue the loss of their current family and friendship networks. I repeatedly tell them that the only reason I am critical is because I want them to be happy and I feel that they are making a choice that makes that happiness less likely.\n\nSo, AITA for Criticizing My Parents' Retirement Choices?","label":1},{"sentiment":0.9999134540557861,"input":"AITA for reacting in anger when my wife made my dad's death about her? | My dad passed four days ago.

This was surprising as she lives 20 miles away; but I was absolutely certain it was her. I said, “Hey Heather! Good to see you again.” She gave me a really funny stare and told me she’s not Heather.\n\nHer voice sounded just like Heather’s as well. She told me her name is Maddie, and it was clear she didn’t recognize me. I walked away feeling super embarrassed and puzzled. That girl looked, sounded and acted **so** identical to Heather in every way, shape and form; to a degree that is impossible to be a simple coincidence.\n\nI pondered things in my mind, and on my way out approached Maddie. I asked her, “Sorry if this is too personal, but I’m wondering - are you adopted by any chance?” She responded that she is, but hasn’t made any effort to find her bio family. I told her that I strongly suspect that I know her identical twin sister, and explained things to her. \n\nI showed a picture of Heather on my phone to her, and to my surprise she didn’t act all that impressed, just giving me a simple, “Hmmmm. Okay.” I told her that I have Heather’s #, am friends with her on Facebook, have her address and would be happy to connect them, and she responded disinterestedly, “No thanks.”\n\nI called Heather later & explained things to her, and **she too** seemed disinterested. I found Maddie’s profile on Facebook (by searching “people who work at \\[name of my gym\\]”) and texted Heather photos of her. But still, she acted disinterested.

All of them were new to me, but he was retaking a few of them after dropping out about half-way through last semester.\n\nI began to write digital study notes on all of our lectures, and we both agreed to write them together and use them as a shared resource. We tried to see if this was a viable method we could be expected to keep up with, but unfortunately he couldn't handle the workload. Beyond that point, they became my personal notes that only I was writing. However, I didn't change the sharing permissions- so he could still access all of my notes at any time.\n\nSoon, all this recent stuff hit and our studying was converted to exclusively online. All of our tests and exams are now online and open-book, making my notes now especially useful- all we have to do is ctrl + f keywords to find the answers, barely any studying needed!\n\nNow when this happened, my partner very much struggled with the transition to online learning. I soon became the only one that was actually watching the online lectures, keeping track of the work that was due, and reminding him of deadlines. When it comes to tests for courses he hasn't done before, he relies entirely on my lecture notes to answer all the questions.\n\nNow, here's where the problem starts. I find the note-writing I do to be quite a large workload, and it imposes quite a bit of stress on me. Recently I've been struggling to complete them in time for the tests coming up in a few days, so I asked my partner if he could help me out by writing notes for a single course lecture.\n\nHis response was no, he wouldn't, because he didn't need my notes for that one course. When I told him that I write notes that he does need for other courses, and I'd appreciate some help and recognition for all the work I've been doing to help him out, he still refused. He expressed that he felt scared he wouldn't do them the right way, and I said I didn't care how they were formatted. Still, he refused.\n\nNow I felt really betrayed and used because of this. He has none of his own work he's been doing- he's with me all day, and all he does is play video games and barely get out of bed. He hasn't even said a single thanks once for all the work I've been doing to keep his grades afloat. He really seems to resent me at all suggesting that he's even slightly reliant upon me.\n\nSo I've finally decided to remove his access to my digital notes, leaving him completely stranded. He hasn't found out yet, and I suspect that he only will once he attempts the test in a few days. I feel a bit of guilt about it, and I don't know whether completely depriving him of that resource will cause him to fail. I also know that he suffers a lot with various illnesses like depression, and maybe he's been struggling with the workload because of it.

Also, on mobile. \n\nI have a fairly close friend that I wish I could see more. We've gone through it. We worked at a minimum wage job together and graduated high school together. We're very different people now (she's married with a baby on the way, and I've been focused on my career), but when we get together it's great. \n\nHere's the AITA. When we graduated high school, I moved 4 hours away. Last week I moved 9 hours away from my home town and where she still lives. My parents never taught me how to drive, and it's never been necessary until recently to learn, so I always went back to hometown via a long (expensive) train ride. I now no longer see my parents, so going back would only be to see her. \n\nNow, dont get me wrong, I really do want to see my friend, but spending $300 for a weekend visit is a lot for me to swallow.

I'm also an introvert, so the idea of being a guest in someone's house for 3 days with no alone time makes me anxious. \n\nBecause of this, I have cancelled more than a few times on plans (she has too, but less than I have), and I'm seriously considering not going to her baby shower because of the cost (I just moved and am sleeping on the floor because I cant afford a bed yet -.-) and the 9 hour trip.

My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n​\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n​\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n​\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n​\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n​\n\nI'm so pissed right now.

I, the husband, am asking if I’m the asshole. \n\nThis is a topic we’ve been debating for the past almost two years now. It’d be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. \n\nMy perspective (husband):\n\nMy wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. \n\nAfter eating something delicious, I can’t quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I’m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. \n\nOver the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child. I didn’t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. \n\nOnce they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife’s contractions started to pick up. \n\nAm I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?\n\nWife’s perspective:\n\nMy husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he’d complain I’d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. \n\nSo as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn’t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. \n\nI did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. \n\nI’d like to also mention it wasn’t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. \n\nHe is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?","label":1},{"sentiment":0.9999830722808838,"input":"WIBTA if I don't tell about a financial aid to my wife's cousin? | (Throwaway because wife knows about my main account)\n\nBackground: my wife is pregnant, her cousin (C) had a baby 2 months ago.

We discussed it a bit with my uncle and aunt but eventually they agreed to get it for me as an early birthday present and everything was good.\n\nThen my Dad started to bring up issues like how I need to study hard in school and not waste my life away. I'd be completely fine if it wasn't the 32nd time in the past week. To give you an idea of the kind of people they've been acting like recently: they reminded me that I had to go out shopping to buy winter clothes for the UK as I won't be used to the cold weather. Fair enough. This was 4 months ago btw. There was a discount going on at a local clothing store this month so naturally I didn't stock up right away. For 3 months straight at least once every 2 days they would come in and \"remind\" me to go stock up on winter clothes. It's more like a lecture on how i need to be responsible when I tell them that I'm waiting for a sale every time.\n\nAs you can probably guess, this dinner wasn't the first time they brought up the issue of me studying hard overseas. I'll admit, after hearing the same shit come out of my Dad's mouth for the 10000th time over the course of the last year I got a bit pissed off and told him to drop. Nothing vulgar and rude. Just a simple: \"That's enough. We've had this conversation before I'm sick of listening to the same thing over and over again when I can't do anything about it\". Cue him flying off the handle talking about how I don't appreciate the good life I'm living now etc.\n\nBut this isn't even the worse part. The worst part is that after he got mad in the restaurant he said \"you know what, you can forget about your new phone\". This is when I blew up. The reason i got so mad is because like everything else, this isn't the first time he's pulled some similar shit. It's always the classic \"I promised you something but now i'm going to create a situation where you're rude to me so I can now use this as an excuse to back out of my promise\".

Everyone pulls their weight around the house and financially and living together hasn't impacted our friendship negatively at all.\n\nThat said recently we have butted heads on one thing. All my life I've had a dog, my parents have always owned them and they are family to me, and since moving out of home I hate not having a dog around. I've been really wanting to adopt one for a month or so now and one of my housemates is keen, he's never been allowed to own a pet before and is more than happy to get a dog. My other housemate is a different story, he flat out said no at first. I kinda predicted it because he doesn't care for dogs and is kinda uncomfortable around them, but I was still annoyed that he just shut it down and wouldn't talk about it. We got into a mini shouting match and I went to bed annoyed with him.\n\nA couple days later we brought up the subject with him again, he still said no but offered a 'compromise'. He said he would agree to getting a dog on 2 conditions:\n\n-1. He wants no responsibility for the dog, that includes training, cleaning, food, walking, medical needs, and any financial things that go along with owning a pet unless in emergencies or if only he could look after the dog for an extended period. \n\n-2. The dog is not allowed in the house.\n\nI told him what I thought of his compromise, that its a joke. I told him I was disappointed he would try weasel out of the expenses given we all agreed that things relating to money would be equal but I was seething at his 'Not allowed inside' demand. My dog is my family, I want to eat dinner with them, chill on the couch with them, let them sleep on my bed etc. He knows that and the fact he would ask that of me and rob me of that is hurtful and selfish. I told him that and another shouting match was had.\n\nAnyway its been a couple days since then and I've been thinking. Its 2 against 1 on the dog thing, and he cannot physically stop us from getting the dog or letting it in when he's not around. Ive been in contact with someone selling a young rottie that looks like an awesome companion. One of our mutual friends said these kind of things should be unanimous but the way I see it we can't do anything about him being selfish and our friendship is strong enough that this won't come between us in the long run.","label":1},{"sentiment":0.9948707222938538,"input":"AITA for telling my friend that his fiance is probably not a studious virgin that she claims to be, that she used to go to tons of frat parties | A friend of mine is getting married to this chick through an arranged marriage.

After adjournment, I turn to T and loudly say, I am extremely upset and angry that you called me out in a public forum over something so trivial.

I left and got more and more angry.

I've always been clingy and I don't want her to be different from me when we've been the same person for so long. \n\nLast night she decided to explode at me and our mom with our dad on her side, they're of the opinion that I should let my sister have space and let her grow up without me but we've been together since conception, I don't want that to change now. \n\nOur mom thinks that it's normal for us to be together and be matching and she's the one who encouraged me to get the job and helped me apply, I applied to my sister's airline as well and if I get a call from them in the next few days, I'd have the opportunity to operate flights with her. She thinks it'll be a big adventure for the both of us. \n\nOur dad thinks that I'm taking her dream, single white femaleing her, and unable to let go of her.

She has a 5 year old large breed dog who I like, but I'm really, really not a dog person. I'm not really an animal person in general, but definitely if I had to have a pet I'd want one that was way less maintenance. Still, she loves her dog, I love her, we're all cool. I'm not mean to the dog, I don't ignore the dog, I play with him sometimes, and I go with her to dog parks and that sort of thing occasionally as well. \n\nA few months ago, my girlfriend started talking about moving in together. I told her I would normally think now is a good time in our relationship for that, but that I wasn't really comfortable living with a dog at this time. She argued and said that she would take 100% responsibility and care of him. I thought it wasn't possible, but she assured me I wouldn't have to do a single thing I didn't want to. \n\nI thought it was a pretty bad idea, but I suggested a trial period where she stays with me, and if it works out by the time my lease is up, then we move into a bigger place together. She agreed wholeheartedly, and moved in.\n\nAt first things were fine. But one week, she got pretty sick, so I took care of her dog that week. Then, she had to go out of town, and I took care of the dog then too though I mentioned to her in the future, she'd need to make other arrangements. Things like this kept cropping up. She needed to go to work early, her friend was in town and she wanted to go out. Sometimes I refused, but each time I did, she kicked up a fuss. I tried reminding her of our deal, but she said it was only sometimes and only for \"extenuating circumstances\" and it was ridiculous to expect her to pay money to watch her dog when I was at home. \n\nSo I told her when my lease was up, I'll be renewing it on my own here, and that I didn't feel like the trial had gone well. She got very upset about that, and started to argue a lot about how she didn't expect NO help, just not a lot, and her dog will live for at least another 5 years, did I expect we'll never live with each other until then. I told her no but right now I value the freedom that I have not caring for another creature. I also said if it changed in either direction, I become more okay with it, or I realize I'll never be okay with it, I'd let her know immediately. She didn't like that either. \n\nSome of her friends have pulled the \"wHaT aBoUt WhEn yOu HaVe KiDs?\" but obviously my kids would be a totally different thing for me, and I've shut it down each time she's tried to argue that. Others think I'm some dog hating monster, which isn't true either. I know that this is a compatibility issue and maybe we need to just break up, so I'd rather not hear that over and over since neither of us seem ready to pull the plug yet, but yeah.

I am the only Vegan. I don't preach or try to convert pothers, it's my choice, and my business.

(I'm a single parent saving for a mortgage). \n\nTo reassure a concerned work colleague, I explained that aside from financial constraints, the thought of being at a table of people eating meat made me feel very uncomfortable. So it really wasn't a big deal for me to miss it and she shouldn't feel bad.\n\nAs well as the annual Christmas meal, we also have a staff Christmas lunch the day before, low key, held in the office, we all bring our own food. A different work colleague sent an email out this week requesting that every one bring a Vegan dish this year. \n\nI felt surprised about this and confused, so asked why this was. The colleague advised that I speak to the person I had confided in, who responded by looking down and not saying anything (sort of in a joking way, but they still wouldn't speak to me, they can be a bit strange sometimes). \n\nPlease bare in mind that Veganism is often a deeply personal choice. It is also difficult to get Vegan food, and is an acquired taste. I'm not going to lie here, some of it is overpriced and grim, \\[if you dont know brands to avoid and cost effective alternatives\\].\n\nWith this in mind, I sent a borderline pleading email out to everyone, thanking them for being thoughtful. I was honest and said that I felt uncomfortable as it seemed restrictive, and it would be better if everyone just brought what they wanted to.\n\nI received an email response refusing my request stating that people 'didn't mind trying Vegan' and 'we are ganging up on you lol'. (I dont think this was meant in a horrible way, but I felt frustrated that I had been ignored).\n\nI spoke to another work college and explained how uncomfortable this was making me and how the Christmas lunch shouldn't be about my Veganism. I also shared how I envisioned people gagging at the food or opening up awkward conversations about Veganism as a lifestyle choice. \n\nMy work colleague was really nice and sent an email saying she would be bringing a meat dish and that the lunch shouldn't be themed and there shouldn't be an issue.\n\nThe manager then responded by email that she would be bringing Vegan dish.

Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective.

I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that.

She snarkily replied that taking 45 years to get a cross on your arm really sounds like it took a lot of thought (he has a cross on his arm and it’s his only tattoo). \n \nI told her to cool it, and that she’s ignorant to bash his cross tattoo when her flowers and butterflies and cursive won’t withstand 45 years of changes either. She started to cry and asked why I even dated her if I had such an issue with tattoos and her dad tried to tell her she needed to calm down but she stormed off and told me she’d venmo me money for an Uber home but that she was going home alone right now. \n \nI don’t know what to do.

This year's photos just came back and my MIL was sharing the album at a birthday party this weekend with extended family and friends. The discussion came around to my wife and I and how long we've been together and someone noticed I wasn't in photos that I should have been and asked about it and my MIL went silent. \n\nSee, I wasn't included in these portraits for a number of years because \"only family\" could be in the photos. Since my wife and i were \"only dating\", they felt I shouldn't be in the portraits because it \"probably wouldn't work out.\"\n\nMy wife and I met in college and dated thru school and had a relatively long engagement as we got on our feet so we were together almost 7 years before our wedding. Despite all our time together, and my wife begging each year, my MIL and SILs insisted that I shouldn't be in the portraits until we said our vows, even the fucking year before our wedding despite the date set and save-the-dates sent. And honestly, it always hurt and was like a yearly reminder that I wasn't truly \"family\" to them. \n\nThe real kicker to me though is that my MIL and SILs were all married and since divorced in that time, one of my SIL twice! So all these photos that I wasn't worthy to be part of include men that are not only *not* a part of the family anymore, but 2 were really assholes and all three of my SILs marriages were short-lived relationships and ended in messy divorces on really bad terms. But me, who is still here and the other half of the only long lasting and successful relationship of my wife's immediate family, was not included in this tradition for nearly a decade. \n\nSo anyway, I started laughing when the question came up and went over the story and pointed out how all these jerks are in the photos but I wasn't allowed. And I apparently took a bit of joy in the fact that since my MIL and SILs pretty much hate those men now, the portraits are kind of useless and stay locked in a cabinet all year because of it. (It used to practically be a coffee table book) \n\nWell, my MIL started crying, my SILs were offended at my portrayals of their marriages, and everyone else who didn't see the humor was pretty much upset at me for calling them out for their unfair practices. \n\nI felt like I acted fairly at the time by just pointing out how the tradition backfired but my wife mentioned that I still get pissy each year over the photos and always have something snarky to say and it's long past time I let it go. Maybe she's right, she usually is, but I can't tell you how irked I get every time that damn album comes out. \n\nSo, AITA?","label":1},{"sentiment":0.9995631575584412,"input":"WIBTA if I requested my friend to wear a certain color of hijab for my wedding? | We're Americans, both 26F, and have been best friends since we first met in college.

He has some co-hosts, legit recording equipment, and he has a decent following. I always go to the studio to just sit on the side and watch as he records, but I've noticed that he's started to become a bit different ever since the start of the podcast.\n\nOn a podcast a few weeks ago, the topic was 2016 movies as my boyfriend and his co-hosts revisited some of their favorite and least favorite films of 2016. One co-host brought up Arrival as their favorite film of 2016 and while he was talking, my boyfriend loudly says \"YAWN!\" and he explains that he thought Arrival was boring. My boyfriend then goes into this giant rant about how he hated Arrival, calling it one of the most overrated movies of all time. He says that he looks down on people who like the movie because he claims that they \"think they're smart\" and he says that he's proud of himself for \"seeing past that movie\" and it's \"faux attempts at intelligence\". And whenever someone would try to change the subject, he'd just interrupt them and go right back to talking about how much he hates Arrival.\n\nThen just a few days ago, he was recording another show and the topic was MCU movies. My boyfriend brought up that he thinks Age of Ultron is a \"hidden gem\" and \"massively overlooked masterpiece\". One of his co-hosts scoffed when he said those things and that set off my boyfriend. He starts attacking the co-host for his taste in movies and started saying stuff like \"Just because I have a better understanding of the art of film-making, it doesn't mean you have to be jealous of me.\" That was actually enough for the co-host to just walk out in the middle of the show and my boyfriend said \"That's fine, I only want to talk to true auteur's of film on this show.\" \n\nAnd just yesterday, I asked him if we could see Shazam together, but he simply responded with \"I deserve better than those DC movies.\" I confronted him and told him that he needs to stop acting like he's smarter than everyone over his taste in film and he said \"Truth hurts, doesn't it?\" And it's like this a lot.

I would often float them money to get food, medication, etc. But when they called him, they got radio silence. \n\nWhen my grandmother felt that her time was coming, she wanted us to visit her a bit more often. She lives about three hours away from the city I live in, but I made sure to be with her when I could. My brother lives two hours away, and didn’t see her for the entire year.

He even tried to throw himself on the casket when they were lowering it into the ground. \n\nA group of people were surrounding him and trying to comfort him after the funeral.

I am a 38-year old divorced woman with a 4-year old son. I recently began online dating (we divorced about 2 years ago) and signed up for a Match profile. I of course mention my son and that I'm divorced in my profile. So far I've gone on a few casual dates, but I am eventually looking for something serious. I would prefer to get into a relationship with a man who also has children because 1) I want to be with someone who won't be surprised about what parenting actually entails and 2) I would be less worried about being pressured to have another biological child (I have a history of infertility). \n\n​\n\nSo I began talking to a man I met on Match, 36 years old, who has three daughters. His kids are a bit older than mine; they are 16, 13, and 12. After some correspondence, we met up for our first date. I was enjoying myself and our conversation, and found myself attracted to him. \n\n​\n\nThen we began talking about our kids. We talked about our custody arrangements with our exes. The man said that he had joint custody with his younger two girls, but his oldest daughter lives out of state. I was confused as to why he had different arrangements for his kids. Turns out he has not one, not two, but three women that he has had children with! (And he has not been married to any of them.)\n\n​\n\nWhen he told me this, I immediately knew I wasn't going to see him again. My ex and I are friendly, and even we have challenges with the co-parenting thing. Negotiating co-parenting as a potential stepmother with three different women (if we were to get to that point) is just not something I want to take on. I'm really not looking for a NSA relationship, so I thought why lead this guy on?\n\n​\n\nWe parted ways after the date and I didn't say anything then, because I thought maybe he didn't even like me all that much and it would be a moot point. Well of course, he texted me the next day asking me out again. I tried to ghost him for a couple of days, but he called me out. So I finally responded saying that unfortunately I didn't think I could get involved with someone who has children with three different women, due to the logistical challenges all of the communication and arrangements must pose in his life. He hasn't responded.\n\n​\n\nSome of my friends say I am being judgmental and making assumptions. They ask whether I would be upset if someone refused to date me because I have \"baggage\" (a son and being divorced). Other friends say that it makes sense I wouldn't want to get involved with someone with this much baggage, as I have to think about my son first and foremost. So, AITA?\n\n​\n\nTL;DR: I am divorced with a child, I broke it off with a guy when I found out he had three kids with three different women.","label":0},{"sentiment":0.995361328125,"input":"AITA for not telling my bf about the size of my student loan? | Bf of 1.5 years recently suggested we move in together.

She helped me out so much when I was struggling with addiction and had just always been there for me. I helped her some with her depression, although definitely not to the extent she helped me, but I tried.\n\nWe’ve been friends for over 10 years, and I feel no romantic attraction towards her. None. I don’t know for sure but I’m fairly certain she feels no attraction for me either.\n\nYesterday we (my friend and I) were watching a movie at her house, and then my girlfriend was going to come and we(my girlfriend and I) were going to go out for dinner.\n\nI was sitting on the sofa with my friend, and we were right next to each other. It’s only a two seat sofa so there wasn’t really another option. We weren’t hugging or anything, but were were touching just by happenstance, and neither of us felt the need to move. \n\nWe’re close enough that just sitting and chilling is just, nice. There doesn’t have to be a romantic element to it or anything, just nice. My girlfriend came, and when we left she freaked out saying that it’s basically cheating and that I had to stop being close (physically) with her. I mean, I do similar things with male friends, just sitting on the sofa chilling, so I don’t really see the problem.\n\nAITA?","label":0},{"sentiment":0.9997429251670837,"input":"AITA for not tipping when the waitress made me pay for an item she left off my bill | I was at the pub and I ordered 2 pounds of wings and a 7up.

You either love it or hate it. She's also from Greece and is strong on keeping traditions around the holidays. Christmas is always at her house and she is the only cook.\n\nSince it's at her house, she is also left with all of the cleaning. My two sisters and brother try to help as much as possible, but she'll refuse us (which leaves everything to her once we leave). We also cook but she doesn't want us to do it because we \"don't do it right\". If we did bring something we've made, she has no problem telling us how we need to make it better. We are all open for suggestions but her delivery can be harsh.\n\nThe cherry on the top for every holiday is that she'll start to get stressed as the day progresses. Each time, she announces in a loud voice, \"Next year, we are going out to eat! I am not cooking again!\" And every year we agree and lock her down to a promise that is always broken by her.\n\nThis year, my siblings and I decided Christmas will be at one of our houses with Chinese food. It's the only \"outside food\" she likes. It took a few days but once we nailed down the details, I called my mother and told her to (1) Not to worry about her house - we'll be at sister's house. (2) We're buying the food, and it'll just be a relaxed holiday. She doesn't have to do a thing except spend time with all of us and the εγγονια (grandkids). (3) That we want her there to finally relax and enjoy the day. But if this way of celebrating Christmas this one time bothers her, we won't force her to come. And that she's welcomed to come by after for baklava, coffee, and presents.\n\nI explained that we are not happy with her stressing herself out on the holidays, but if she won't accept help then she needs to (in gentler terms) shit or get off the pot. She wasn't thrilled, but she accepted.\n\nEarlier this week, my sister calls me in confidence. My mother made her promise not to say anything to me, but now my mother wants to have Christmas at her place. All the planning and compromises we did just went out the window.\n\nI'm fumed. This isn't the first time she'll change her mind; when confronted, she'll just hug me, shush me and say, \"It's okay\". Rinse and repeat.\n\nI'm currently pregnant with my baby. The doctor has planned on inducing me the first week of February. My mother has repeatedly told me that she wants to be in the room with me because she cannot relax at home knowing I'm in labor. \n\nToday, I called my mom and told her that the doctor is pushing the induction a week later due to improvement of health. I've decided not to call my mom until my daughter is born. Once things are settled, I'll own the truth and when she gets upset, I'll hug her, shush her, and tell her \"It's okay\" and promise next time it'll be different.\n\nI have a feeling I know the answer already, but....

All his relatives live in Italy so he spends about half of his time there. He also owns a house there. He always asks me to come but I’ve only gone a few times as I (31F) feel very uncomfortable not being able to converse with the people there. When he married me, he asked me to promise to learn Italian. It is very important to him that his children know his language and can speak to his family. He also wants me to know it not only for those reasons but he says that Italian is close to Spanish and knowing Spanish will open up a lot of opportunities for me.\n\nHe started me on Duolingo but I have a full time job so it’s kind of difficult for me to do it everyday. I didn’t make much progress so he tried to teach me himself.

I started gong for the first few weeks but I didn’t learn anything so I stopped and started spending the time he thought I was at the lesson at restaurants.\n\nHis mother had been calling a lot more frequently lately. She called and I picked up. She talked very slowly but I still couldn’t understand her. Turns out that after that phone call, she called my husband and said that I wasn’t doing well at learning Italian. He talked to me and I admitted that I hadn’t been going for the past two years.

Her boyfriend was also there. My friend and I talked amongst ourselves and she complained about her boyfriend bitching about her breast implants that she got three months ago. We haven’t really talked about her implants before. Her boyfriend overheard and this started an argument. Her boyfriend said that she has these scars under each breast that still are noticeable and off-putting so he’s justified in not wanting to do anything with them until they’ve healed. My friend said they’re barely even noticeable and was in the process of showing them to me before I told her that I didn’t want to see her breasts. \n\n\nShe said that her boyfriend is making her feel very bad about her decision, even though she did it to be less self-conscious with her previous A cups. Her boyfriend said they were a lot better before and not like cantaloupes glued to her chest. He also said that she’s really financially irresponsible for using all of the trust fund money she got from her aunt after she died on breast implants. He said that 20 year olds shouldn’t be spending $8000 on breast implants. My friend said that her boyfriend knew that she has been wanting implants for a long time, so the least he can do is be happy for her. \n\n\nHer boyfriend asked me what I thought and I said although her boyfriend should try to act more supportive of her, I ultimately side with him. I said that the breast implants probably aren’t the best use of her money since we’re in college and her future career doesn’t depend on having big breasts. I also said that although her satisfaction is the most important, but frankly from her boyfriend’s, mine, and I assume most people’s perspectives, her new breasts are out of proportion with her petite figure. Her boyfriend said that he tried so hard to convince not to mutilate her body, but she wouldn’t listen. \n\n\nMy friend said that she thought I would have her back and not shit all over what was a major life decision that made her infinitely happier with her body. I said that her happiness is the most important, but she needs to prepare for people who think her breasts are a little bit ridiculous and her spending a little bit frivolous. Her boyfriend put out his hand for a high five, but that was immature and inappropriate so I didn’t high five him. \n\n\nI asked my friend what her parents thought of her spending $8000 on breast implants. She said they didn’t care. Having known her mom for a while now, I smelled bullshit but I didn’t say anything about that. My friend said that after knowing what it’s like to have both small and big breasts, that big breasts get much more attention and she was jealous of girls with big breasts before and that’s what I am now when I put her down.

My husband asked what breed were the dogs (pitbull & bulldog mix) and how old they were (5 months). My husband has ALWAYS wanted a pitbull or bulldog.\n\n Husband asked me if I was okay with him bringing a dog home. I told him it was up to him whatever he decided to do.

He said that I'm being a jerk because I know that he doesn't have a set work schedule. I tell him it's not my problem and he should've thought about that before he brought the dog home.

Almost every day he tells me the BS he has to deal with from managers and co-workers and almost every day I tell him how he deserves better and should look for better but he kind of shuts down when I make these suggestions.\n\n So a couple days ago he comes to my place all smiles and suuuper excited. Like \"bro, guess what happened at work.\" I'm thinking ohhhh shit, this mf finally got a raise. He tells me that their busy as all hell when the owner pulls up and gets out of his car looking pissed as fire. As soon as he gets out he points at Jesse and orders him over to the car, hands on his waist pacing back and forth clearly irritated. According to Jesse he literally runs over to the owners car. When Jesse gets over there, the owner switches up and begins to explain how much he appreciates Jesse for his hard work and YEARS of dedication to the business.\n\n The owner then tosses Jesse the keys to the car and pauses for a moment. Long enough of a moment to give Jesse the thought that the owner just gave him the car. The owner then chuckles and says nahhh I cant give you the beamer but I got you something else, open the trunk and check it out. Jesse takes the keys, opens up the trunk,(Again I'm thinking to myself like...it better be a kilo of bam bam or at least 3 mac book pros in that bitch) and feasts his eyes on...a mf'n air fryer.\n\n Jesse is telling me this shit like he's the luckiest dude in the world, and I, somewhat regrettably so begin to dismantle every bit of his excitement by describing how much of an insult and slap in the face this \"gift\" from his employer is. I'm telling him shit like \"you should've thrown that air fryer across the damn street and told him to go fuck himself\" etc etc. My rant probably lasted 3 minutes and at the end of it I look at his face and he looks embarrassed and somewhat ashamed. He's not looking at me while he say's \"well I thought it was pretty cool I really wanted one of those things\". I again go into explaining why he should feel disrespected and not appreciated until I snap out of it. Then he tells me maybe I'm right, followed by \"well I gotta get to my other job\" but I really feel like he just left because I shit all over his good day. What's your take? AITA\n\nTL:DR Friend of mine has been working at a place that's given him less than a dollar raise in 8 years. Owner gives him an air fryer to show appreciation.

Could model for local stores as a side gig, or have a reasonably profitable snap chat premium. \n> \n> \n> \n>**9**: High end models that make a fortune from their looks. \n> \n> \n> \n>**10:** Reserved for legendarily attractive people.

About 3/4 of the way down the sidewalk, with a trashcan not even 25 feet away, she tossed the banana peel into the bushes. It landed on top of the bush and she just kept walking.

There's a trash can right in front of you!\" complete with the WTF hand gesture; pointing to the trash can.\n\nShe ripped into me, claiming it's organic and feeds the animals.

She said she was, and asked why. I sent a picture of the jumpsuit and said that this was what I’d been sent in place of a much brighter colour.

I was going to leave it, but one of the bridesmaids commented with a poorly-taken picture of me from behind with drawn-on devil horns and tail. I reacted on impulse, and posted screenshots of the conversation where the bride had told me that my outfit was fine, with a comment saying that it was a shame that the bride couldn’t tell me to my face there was an issue, and that since I’d been asked for ‘receipts’, here they were.

When the invitations were sent out at the beginning of the year, she asked my boyfriend to go with her. He obviously said yes. They were both single at the time. They paid for his flight and he'd share her hotel room.\n\nWhen the wedding was pushed back, the parents reached out to him to tell them they'll figure out new flight times once a new date was confirmed. I think it might be inappropriate for him to go now. We've been dating for a few months and she just started seeing a new guy. I brought it up to my boyfriend and he said that she usually waits a long time before someone she is dating to meet her family and he still wants to go. He's excited for the beaches and the open bar.

My thought was that I should let him know he’s got the wrong number or username or whatever, but I was driving and just thought I’d deal with it later. Ok, so I forgot about it and later that night I check my phone and I have like 6 more messages from the dude and they are all these personal, lovestruck messages - the guys no Casanova but it’s charming and I’m sure any woman would appreciate his flattery.

Three more messages the next morning, and he’s still pouring his heart out how he wants to be with her, showing he got his hair braided for her, etc. But at this point I’m like shit, now this guy has left all these messages and he must know they’ve been viewed and now if I tell him it’s the wrong number he’ll 1) probably be mortified at himself for sending all those very vulnerable, personal messages and 2) probably be pissed that some dick saw them all and didn’t bother to tell him it was the wrong number. I was probably overthinking all of this, so I did decided to do nothing and hope he just figures out he’s got the wrong girl (guy).\n\nFast forward a month - I’m still getting messages from said dude, and now I feel like I absolutely can’t break the guy's heart that all his love has been for naught and yeah, I knew he had the wrong number all along.

Just started her 3rd year of Uni.\n\nSituation: In order to make us moving in together work, she got a part time job. We both contribute 100% of our finances. We are comfortable enough with the money we have to be able to have family vacations, run 2 decent cars, rent our house, never want for anything etc.\n\nShe has always insisted on working part time since we moved in together, but has always complained about her job, regardless of what it is (through 3 different ones). After her first proper shift in this 3rd job, she complained louder than ever, almost in tears when talking about it. I told her to quit now and look for another job, it wasn't worth ruining her dissertation year over. \n\nOver this period of complaining, she kept repeating to me \"I'm not a lazy person, I don't want to not-work, it's just this job.\" and \"I used to work full time and be a single mother, I'm a hard worker\".\n\nShe did, and she has offers of a couple of jobs now, but h has now started dragging her feet about getting started with these new jobs, as well as saying that she has been talking to some friends and that they think she shouldn't have to work, I should just be happy she is contributing her student finance to our outgoings.\n\nShe has also started saying that she is considering doing her Masters. Then her PGCE (teaching qualification).\n\nI am starting to get big \"I don't want to work\" vibes in general, which will definitely impact our future plans. Wedding, having a kid , buying a house. I am not down for having a child out of wed-lock and as I say we are both in our 30's, so it's not like we have an indefinite amount of time to do that.\n\nNow, I've never thrown my income in her face and dismiss the disparity if she raises it, but I used to have ~£1500 disposable income before we moved in together, I now have none. I'm now getting concerned that she is more interested in extending the length of time that she doesn't have to work, rather than building our life together that we have had planned.\n\nWhenever we talk about it (it keeps coming back up), I say the same. Working part time and being at university is not impossible (her brother did it, my sister did it, one of my best friends worked full time while at Uni). That yes, we could get by without her wage, but things would be tighter and may impact our wedding/future plans. Especially if she is planning on doing her masters and putting off getting into work by another year, which definitely would put a spanner in our plans and we would have to reconsider buying a house and having a child. If she needs more time, that she should try cutting down on things like reading facebook or watching TV alone in the middle of the day rather than dropping work.

They paid for the kid's activities. He recently moved his whole family across the country after several conflicts with them, breaking my parent's hearts. \n\nNow on to me. I have been separated from an abusive husband for more then 3 years now. I have chosen to put kids off until I am both financially and mentally stable.

We named him after my dad and their names are identical. My dad was known better by his nickname Jack. My son and my dad were exceptionally close. They hung out together and knew secrets about each other. It was adorable. Then my dad died in 1999 when my son was ten and that stopped. As my son has become a man his physical resemblance to my dad is uncanny. It brings me joy to watch him.\n\nI have a brother seven years younger and we don’t get along well.

It was insufferable but I bit my tongue.\n\nWhen my son went to college he adopted the nickname Jack. He wanted his own identity. Everyone who knows him since 2007 knows him as Jack, including his wife. My wife and I were good with that and even though we go back and forth with Jack/John we like it.

My girlfriend adopted a shelter dog recently. Her previous owner neglected her and she spent most of her life in a cage. Since she was neglected she was never house trained and she can be destructive around the house. When my girlfriend and I leave for work she’ll claw at the door and leave scratch marks and leave bite marks on some of the furniture. My girlfriend wasn’t aware the dog had these problems but she did know she needed to house train it. When my dad learned about this he was pissed and he told my girlfriend to get her dog under control and that until it’s trained she either has to cage it or leave it outside in the cold because he doesn’t want it messing up his house. Since she spent most of her life in a cage my girlfriend doesn’t want to cage her dog but he told me to make sure this rule is enforced. \n\nYesterday my dad told me he was coming over to talk to me about some things and to check on the house. My girlfriend has been slacking on training her dog so she still not house broken and destructive and I haven’t been enforcing my dad’s rule.

I moved out of my abusive parents’ house, and when I was moving all my stuff into my friend’s flat, where I now live full time, I brought the family cat along. Although the other members of my family could take care of him, we both liked each other the most so I brought him down.\n\nFor context, my girlfriend has some inflammatory conditions that make prone to corneal ulcers. She had one at the start of 2019 and it terrified her as it left her with a corneal scar, so now she’s vigilant about cleaning her eyes and keeping away from triggers. One of which has turned out to be my cat.\n\nWhenever she’s up here she sneezes all night, rubs her eyes and makes a mountain of tissues as she blows her nose every two minutes. She constantly complains of dry, itchy eyes, and even though I’ve recommended antihistamines, she’s tried them and says they don’t do much for her. Since then, she’s begged me to take the cat back up to my dad’s (with whom I still have little contact) as it’s not good for her or the cat. First, her argument for herself is that she doesn’t want to come up anymore because she’s worried about her eyes, and she spends the whole time miserable. She says she can’t even hug me anywhere else because of the cat hair on my clothes will trigger a sneezing fit or irritate her eyes (and he is a long-haired cat so he sheds everywhere). I’ve recommended trying another type of antihistamine, but she refuses.\n\nHer argument for the cat is that this situation isn’t good for the cat. I’ve moved from a house in a secluded council estate to a top floor flat right on two main roads. My cat is very much an outdoor cat, he’s always wanting out to hunt mice and birds. He’s always preferred being outside since he was a kitten. I can’t let him out here as the drop from my window is too high, or let him out the door as he can’t get back in. I don’t want to let him run around because he doesn’t know the area as well as my parents’ area that he’s known all his life, and I’m worried about the roads. He cries to get out at night for hours on end, keeping me up to the point where my uni work is starting to get affected from lack of sleep. My girlfriend is insistent this isn’t a good life for him, although the attempts to train him seem to be doing ok, where he uses the litter box instead of going outside, and I love his company even when it’s just the one room.\n\nMy girlfriend is now threatening to stop coming down to my place entirely, which I don’t really want considering we both consider it a safe haven away from her family. She argues that my parents will keep him fed and watered, and he’ll be back in a familiar environment, going out whenever he pleases. But she’s never had a cat herself, and I don’t think she realises it’s not easy to let go like that, especially when I barely see my family anymore.\n\nAITA?","label":1},{"sentiment":0.9912024736404419,"input":"WIBTA for asking for the owners contact information due to damage done to my vehicle that the service team has already taken the steps to rectify? | I took my car in for an oil change at the local stealership.

Google and his voicemail indicated that his business hours were from 2pm - 6pm. I showed up at 5pm on a Sunday and his business was closed. I then went next-door to the neighboring business and asked if anyone knew where he was. The lady there said he had something come up and left. I expressed frustration that he wasn't there and said \"this is no way to run a business\". She pointed out that I was one to talk, considering I was trying to file my taxes after the deadline.

I knew that finances are usually probably one of the biggest reasons that relationships fail, so during the engagement we made a point of it to iron out what our finances would look like under certain outcomes, our views on children more specifically than \"I don't want them\", what we would do financially if we both decided otherwise, etc.. It was good to have these things set out then, we both got lawyers and drafted a prenup, and I thought we were on good footing then. We agreed that we would have separate finances and contribute proportionally to joint expenses like utilities, mortgage, grocery bills, etc.. For small things like gym memberships, Netflix, cell phones, etc. we are on the same plan and pay proportionally, but we agreed that major financial things like cars, health insurance, and taxes would be separate.\n\nThat had worked for us for a year and a half, but our agreement is now dying a death by a thousand cuts. Firstly, we had agreed on a fixed payment responsibility, directly proportional to our own earnings, but she argued that we change it 8 months ago. When we were engaged we agreed our responsibilities were 70/30 (97k/45k) and would stay fixed to the proportion of our earnings. But she argued 8 months ago that even though our income is 72/28 (180k/70k) it hurts her a lot more than it does me to contribute, so it should be 80/20. This didn't matter much to me at the time, and it's technically true that paying bills doesn't hurt me as much relatively, but it's been the first step in a worrying trend. This year she argued that we should file our taxes jointly. I was pretty against this, as that was one of the things we explicitly agreed to do separately, but to her, it was impractical not to, since we would both be losing out on a modestly large amount with no “real benefits”. Even though I wasn't for it, it was hard to argue for losing out on the amount we lost be filing separately without any \"real benefit\", so I agreed to do our taxes that way this year.\n\nAnd now it's health insurance, with a similar argument, basically. She has to drive “hours” to see “crappy specialists” that take the plan her employer provides while I don't have those problems, it would actually cost less to add her to my plan and have her pay the difference, etc.. Again, it's technically true that my health insurance is a lot better than her's and it wouldn't cost more than what we pay in total, but I feel like pretty soon we aren't even going to have separate finances. I'm having difficulty expressing my point to her since it's not necessarily practical, but I feel the principle is worth defending, even if it's not the path of least resistance. Of course, to her, it's silly to pay more because of \"my ego\", but I think it's worth having the discipline not to abandon an agreement the second it becomes slightly impractical. \n\nAITA?","label":1},{"sentiment":0.999815821647644,"input":"AITA for keying a car that was parked in my assigned spot? | I pay $85 a month for this spot in my apartment complex, and the garage is gated off so random cars shouldn’t usually get in.

In our first apt, we had a 2br 1 bath place that was tiny. I usually was in my room, but aside from our rooms there was really no privacy or space. We lived together fine, but it felt cramped. This summer we moved into a much larger 3br 2 bath apt.**\n\nI pay for two bedrooms (one is my office) and I also pay the pet fee for my two cats. My RM has known that I have wanted a pet snake and has been adamantly against it even before we moved in together (which I agreed to, esp because the space we were going to be sharing didn’t allow pets). Now that we are in a bigger place, I would really like to bring a snake home since I have room in my bedroom.\n\nThe snake that I want to bring home is a ball python. Ball pythons are generally known to be docile. The snake will NOT leave my room. My sister has agreed to care for the snake whenever I travel since she has her own ball pythons. Basically, my RM would never see the snake, and will be very securely contained within my room to make sure it does NOT escape. I will be adding a door draft stopper to my door to make sure, even if it does escape, it will not be able to leave my room. I know my RM has afraid of them, and I would never be malicious and abuse her fear of them. I genuinely love and care for my RM, and would take every precaution to make sure she feels safe.\n\nI’ve always admired snakes, I think they’re beautiful and I’ve always wanted to have one as a pet. My art brand is named waxsnake in honor of them, my first tattoo planned is a black snake on my arm or my back. I have been set on the idea of a pet snake for a very long time. Now that we are living where space and conditions allow, I really want to bring one home.\n\nRM:\n\nWhen discussing moving in together OP suggested down the line getting a snake. I always said I never wanted to live in a same house with a snake every time it has been suggested. I have a huge snake phobia. I had snakes in my yard growing up and would have anxiety attacks when I was surprised by one. Like full on sobbing and needing hours to recover. Everytime I see one I feel pure panic and afterwards I feel uneasy in my own skin. \n\nWhen I was a kid there was a pet snake in my house and my parents reassured me a thousand times it would not get out. It did get out and I never felt quite as safe in my house even when it was found. OP is my BFF and has always known about this phobia and has assured me in the past that she would not get a snake if we lived together, but she does bring it up from time to time and I always say no, cause it makes my skin crawl to think about. \n\nI want her to be happy but I would never feel comfortable in my own home, even if I never see it.

My GF and I have been dating for 4 years, engaged for 1, and our wedding is in a month (using a friend's backyard). We started dating right when I got my dog Shelley from the pound, and we've all been together ever since. I got really into training Shelley and she's super well-behaved, knows all sorts of cool tricks, and I thought it would be funny and memorable if she was the ringbearer for our wedding ceremony. I got her this funny dog t-shirt to wear, I've been working with her on holding the ring basket, and I think it's going to be great.\n\nThe issue is this. Our families are both thrilled about our wedding, including the kids on both sides. One of them is my girlfriend's nephew (10M). The other day we were over at my GF's sister's house for a barbecue when her sister came up to us with the nephew alongside, saying he wanted to ask us something. We kneeled down and he kind of quietly asked if he could be the ringbearer for the wedding. I think he's been looking for something to do since we've been trying to save money and everyone on both sides has been helping us, so I'm pretty sure it's not just something his mom put him up to.\n\nAnyways my GF and I both thought it was really sweet but we told him that we already had someone picked out for the role, and offered to let him help in another way. He said okay but he definitely looked like he was about to cry. Later my GF was talking to her sister and under some pretty direct questioning let her know that our dog was going to be the ringbearer. Things got pretty uncomfortable, there was no shouting or anything but we both could tell her sister and her sister's husband were pissed so we left.\n\nMy GF and I are both thinking about how to solve this. We are both on board with having the dog be the ringbearer, it's our wedding, it's a once in a lifetime moment, and surprisingly no one else in the family seems to have a problem with it now that they know. But I don't want to cause any rifts over what's such a minor thing, and it's kind of a small thing to sacrifice to smooth things over with the family, and it's not like Shelley is going to care.

They‘ve asked all parents to continue to pay tuition so that they can pay the teachers, rent, and other workers that are not working. Tuition is normally $1500 a month per child and does not include any food. They’ve started doing daily zoom classes for 30 mins but as all the kids are 5 and under, no one is really sitting for it, especially not my kids.

I sincerely doubt they aren’t making some sort of profit at that rate and I think it’s pretty greedy of them to want parents to continue to pay the same rate through the remainder of the school year instead of prorating the amount to something that would just sustain the closed school until they open it back up. \n\nThere have been some parents who are on the “we should continue to pay so that the teachers can get paid” boat but those parents only pay for one child.

Are we to have 6 sticks of butter for all 6 people in the house? 6 boxes of salt? Some kitchen things it makes no sense to not have communally. I buy ingredient of that kind for whole of kitchen to use. The big drum of olive oil is my olive oil, the salt is my salt, etc. To me it makes no sense someone to be mad over the use of ingredients like this.

She used to be a \"good kid\" who handled her business and I thought we had a good relationship. The only thing we have ever asked of her is that she go to school, get passing grades, and come home on time, which I don't think is too much to ask of a 17-year-old HS senior.\n\nApparently, it is though and whenever her Dad or I try to implement consequences she screams at us. She screams many entitled things, such as \"since you forced me to go to driver training, you owe me a car and you can't take it away\". Now I did encourage her to take driver training, and paid for it, and spent every single one of the 50+ hours that I needed to in the car with her teaching her how to drive. She then got her license, we gave her a car, then she crashed it into a tree due to reckless driving. After that, I explained that she would need to buy her own car, but she could use an extra one to drive to school and work only. Well fast forward and she has no money, no car, and drives mine where ever the hell she pleases. Both her Dad and I work full-time and don't have the time to babysit her car usage, but clearly there is no way I can trust her.\n\nSo we sold the extra car. The attitude and entitlement are too much some times.\n\nHer Dad found her a car that she could buy for $100 and it needed $100 in repairs and around $120 to get a plate and registration, plus ongoing insurance costs. She has paid $0 so far even though we said she can do payments. She promised $100 out of her last paycheck. When I asked for it, she yelled at me that she had to get gas so she didn't have the money. Today is payday, if I don't get some sort of payment then I am selling the car.\n\nAnd all these car issues are just the tip of the iceberg, but I think they are representative of the problems that we have, Change car to cell phone, curfew, going to class and it is the sameish argument every time. We say those are your obligations, she said I don't have to and you can't make me, and we end up arguing.\n\nClearly, she has been spoiled. I had a shitty childhood and ended up in foster care and homeless, etc., so I just wanted her to have nice things and a nice life and a good chance at making a good future for herself.\n\nNow she says that she is scared of her Dad and me and that is why she doesn't come home or follow the rules.

In my mind, there is no reason for her to be scared of me or her Dad, but you never know what teens are thinking.

When asking for payment I charge them $7, and I “charge myself” $7 as well. This way we each contributed $2 to the cost of the card. This is how I planned on paying for the card when I originally purchased it, although I did not tell anyone. If I go alone, I charge myself $4 for the bucket to go towards the cost of the card. My plan is that after 20 visits, I’ll have $100 from overcharging and the card will be “free” for everyone to enjoy, meaning that once its paid off I’ll only charge the $10 price to split. \n\nNow some of my friends have said that it’s not fair that I’m basically expecting them to pay for my card.

But for health reasons and of course other reasons, of course I would like for her to get back to a healthy weight. \n\nMy girlfriend's bipolar disorder has been a challenge for me, as where I would normally be assertive in a relationship on issues - I often have to back down in arguments because she responds poorly to being challenged. I often feel like I'm walking on ice, but I do my best to try understand her and work at helping her and supporting her as best I can. \n\nShe is not happy with her current weight, and constantly remarks about it and has been complaining about it for over a year without doing anything about it. \n\n I tell her we can work on it together as a team, and both fix our diet. I feel this is the best way to go about it, rather than telling her that SHE needs to lose weight. I don't want her feeling like I'm initiating it, or that it's a journey she needs to take alone.

This kinda irritated me, because it had only been a week since she started. \n\nI felt like she hadn't fully committed, because she was drinking soft drinks and eating chips which are high in carbs so I brought that up, if she wants to see results quicker - that cutting out the junk food completely (rather than cutting down) will help her.

I hugged her a few times and begged her not to be mad, but she kept saying she’s totally fine.","label":1},{"sentiment":0.9999970197677612,"input":"AITA for being proud of doing my job well but causing my parents to be made redundant in the process | I work with a consulting company that basically automates people out of jobs. In the past financial year we're directly responsible for X-thousands of people being made redundant and saving companies fat stacks of money. Basically, people are fallible flesh-bags and where practical we try and replace it with predictable, repeatable solutions.\n\nThis came to awkward scenario. We did an audit of a local industrial company that my parents work at. Throughout this audit, at times, I had to interact with departments/areas my parents were involved in to elicit processes, requirements, etc. After the review, we found we could cut over 60 jobs and improve output with introduction of a particular of-the-shelf solution that required some modification. We provided training and additionally audited aptitude and performance to note which workers would be best to retain, retrain or retrench.\n\nThe result (based on metrics and my work) was that my parents were part of this mass redundancy. I was not allowed to give my parents a heads up. After the news, my parents were/are livid at me. They're telling me I had no loyalty to them and should have fudged numbers to keep them there because they're not not going to find new jobs at their age. They asked me how I can sleep at night knowing I put them out of work. \n\nI told them that I take my job seriously, do my job well and I'm proud of doing a good job. But now my parents, siblings, extended family and some family friends are pretty much angry at me. I've gotten various messages that follow the theme that I should be ashamed. \n\nI'm not sorry for what I did. The job was an enjoyable, challenging experience and we ended up with a happy client!","label":1},{"sentiment":0.9995629191398621,"input":"AITA for being pissed that my parents won’t let me and my boyfriend sleep in the same bed? | I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) for 6 years. We have lived together for 4 years.\n\nRecently we were preparing for a visit to my parent’s house. My mom announces that when we arrive I can have the bedroom in the basement and my boyfriend can sleep on the couch in the living room. I push back, citing that I’ve slept in the same bed with my boyfriend for 4 years. My mom isn’t interested in negotiating. It’s “just not going to happen under her roof”. She said when we’re married we can sleep in the bedroom together.\n\nI’m pissed off and think this is ridiculous. My boyfriend agrees and refuses to sleep on the couch. What’s the move here? I get that it’s her house and her rules but I’m not willing to abide by them.","label":0}]
