I am not comfortable with that large of a dog, and like I said I really don\u2019t like dogs at all. She begged me but I held my ground. I understand it was a frightening situation but she really should have taken care of her dog before leaving.\n\nShe called me crying because I was the only one nearby who could watch her dog. I said sorry but I just wasn\u2019t comfortable. She asked if I\u2019d be willing to drive her dog to our parents 5 hours away. Again, I said no. The dog sheds like crazy and is prone to getting carsick, it would absolutely wreck my car. Plus I felt that asking me to make a 10 hour round trip was a little inconsiderate bc I work full time and have school in the evenings.\n\nEventually my parents showed up to get the dog but they were pissed at me. They said I was being a selfish asshole and that I should\u2019ve helped my sister out. My sister hasn\u2019t talked to me since. \n\nI feel that I was well within my rights to refuse to care for the dog for an unspecified amount of time because it made me uncomfortable. My parents and sister obviously disagree.\n\nBtw her husband is fine and is recovering well.\n\n AITA?", "label": 1}, {"sentiment": 0.9999929666519165, "input": "AITA For not wanting to go to MIL's for Thanksgiving?

My parents and I want to do a small dinner together at our house, nothing fancy, and not more then them and us. Gma doesn't want to leave the house this year.

NSFW | I live in a state where marijuana is legal and often, I restock stuff that I share with my girlfriend. We have been in a long term relationship so we share finances completely. Our roommate and long term best friend hasn't bought anything in a while, which is obviously fine, but I spent a decent amount of money ($200) getting some fun stuff and she actively used/participated. I love when our schedules allow us to relax and have fun like this because we all casually smoke, but she used her fair share and hasn't offered to pay or buy more. I mentioned us running low recently and said something like \"let me know if you want to go in on more together since we bought last time\" and she got a bit offended. We don't have strict money boundaries and will buy each other coffee/pick things up because we live together and don't sweat the small things. However, I recently changed jobs which threw off my finances so I don't have extra money to choose to partake and buy more soon. It's really not a big deal, but a third of $200 is significant in our young adult lives as we're in college and money is generally tight. \n\nWIBTA for asking her to pitch in or buy next round?

My beautiful Fiancee is German and Turkish, and grew up in a strict Muslim family. When her father learned that she was traveling to America to study abroad, he was distraught. When he learned she was dating me, he basically stopped speaking to her entirely. I felt terrible. She loves her father very very much, and I knew I was to blame. When I proposed, he essentially disowned her and said he never wanted to see her again. This broke me and her's hearts. I never intended to cause this much pain and hardship for either of them.

In the past financial year we're directly responsible for X-thousands of people being made redundant and saving companies fat stacks of money. Basically, people are fallible flesh-bags and where practical we try and replace it with predictable, repeatable solutions.\n\nThis came to awkward scenario. We did an audit of a local industrial company that my parents work at. Throughout this audit, at times, I had to interact with departments/areas my parents were involved in to elicit processes, requirements, etc. After the review, we found we could cut over 60 jobs and improve output with introduction of a particular of-the-shelf solution that required some modification. We provided training and additionally audited aptitude and performance to note which workers would be best to retain, retrain or retrench.\n\nThe result (based on metrics and my work) was that my parents were part of this mass redundancy. I was not allowed to give my parents a heads up. After the news, my parents were/are livid at me. They're telling me I had no loyalty to them and should have fudged numbers to keep them there because they're not not going to find new jobs at their age. They asked me how I can sleep at night knowing I put them out of work. \n\nI told them that I take my job seriously, do my job well and I'm proud of doing a good job.
