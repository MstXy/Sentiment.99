I asked her who told her, and she said mom.\n\nI asked my wife why she thought telling Mary she can have the car was a good idea and she replied that she knew Mary liked the car and we were going to buy her a car anyway so why not just give her one of the cars no one drives. I told her that the car belonged to my dad and I don\u2019t want to give it to away as its very close to my heart and special to me, she said it would be nice and mean a lot to Mary if she got the car as it would show her how much she means to me.

I got a text last week saying i wasn't invited since it's a very small wedding, with Covid-19 and all. Fine, i don't really get along with my brother anyway.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. My mom sent a picture of her wedding gift directly to me, and called right after. It seemed weird, so i asked \"why are you sending it directly to me and not in the family group chat?\" as everyone in the family always does. It also dawned on me that nobody mentioned anything about the wedding in the group chat. Hm. Weird. She stutters and eventually confesses everyone in the whole family is invited to the wedding. Even my aunt whom they never talk to, and don't live close to us. It's not as small as it seemed.\n\nSo why is she sending it directly to me? Because everybody, every single person in my family, agreed to keep silent about the wedding. \"Because I would get mad i was the only one not invited\", which is a direct quote from my aunt. I don't get along with my brother, so not getting invited is fine. What hurts is everybody lying to me. Flat to my face, even whenever i asked about the wedding in the past weeks. My mom confessed she told me because she didn't want me to see the happy wedding family pictures with everyone in it, except me.\n\nI feel deceived, lied to, and honestly disgusted.

She starts doing what she always does, saying things like \"don't get mad at me, i can't take you being mad at me.\". The guilt tripping starts, she plays the victim. It's nothing new, so i avoid her texts.\n\nThen my twin-sister starts texting. She calls me sick in the head that i get mad over this. I replied, explaining very clearly that i'm just mad about the lying and deceit. She calls me sad and pathetic, says it's really low to kick up a fuss about the situation. How can i do this to our mother. Etc. After some 20 to 30 really aggressive texts (without me replying or reading at all), i was called cruel, disgusting, crazy, and a \"stupid bitch\".

So the insults turn to him and even his family (what?). In the end he blocked her too.\n\nMy aunt etc also texted me. Nobody apologized or even validated my feelings. My whole family is mad at me.\n\nSo my question: I feel i'm in the right about the lies and deceit, but the sheer hate and disgust from my sister and emotional blackmailing from my mom and aunt is overwhelming.

His great grandparents were from a princely state in Colonial India, during British rule. \n\nAfter India gained independence, the government abolished all princely titles, and the former Royal families became regular citizens. \n\nHowever, these families have retained their wealth and popular support and the people from their town still see them as their Royal family. In short, they are influential people. \n\nI didn't know about my fiance's background for years, and upon finding out, I even broke up with him because I was intimidated.\n\nAnyway, So I'm half Indian, born to a British father and my Indian Hindu mother.

I was curious about it and I found that some people can pay a good amount of money for them, so I thought about selling it, but I still hadn\u2019t really do it.\n\nFlash forward a couple of days and I\u2019m in a meeting with my family, including , my cousin. I don\u2019t remember how but I brought up the fact that I found many things, including the sword, in the house. Immediately after I said that my cousin asked me where it was. And he told me that our grandfather had \u201cpromised\u201d him the saber to continue the tradition. My mother and uncle said that it was a great idea for my cousin to get the saber and \u201ckeep the tradition alive\u201d. But I was definitely not happy with this. I told him that I was planning on selling it and that I didn\u2019t care about the tradition, the house is mine and so is the saber.\n\nOf course all my family sided with him, they call me selfish and even said that \u201cI was disrespecting my grandfather\u201d. I\u2019m not doing that, he gave me his house and the saber was there, it\u2019s rightfully mine. But that didn\u2019t stopped my family from getting angry and not talking to me. Now even my son ( who didn\u2019t even had that big of a relationship with my side of the family ) is calling me selfish. Am I being selfish?

So, here goes: (Thanks in advance for your comments and candor.)\n\nMy parents are going to retire in the next two years and my Mom used to joke about moving to a retirement community at least six states away -- it would take a 2.5 hour plane flight to go there. Recently, she and my Dad took a trip down there to \"explore the possibilities\". When they got back it turned out that they bought a plot of land at a particular development and were very excited to tell me and my brother.\n\nMy brother said one positive sentence about how he is happy that they are happy. I tend to be more critical about everything and so I ask them what made them want to move to the retirement community.\n\nMy mother tells me that she really wants to be part of a community, but I counter that in our hometown, which has a very active PTA, Boy/Girl Scout Groups, Parents who Chaperone Field Trips, Religious Center Sisterhoods, etc. she never took the initiative to be part of those groups. She responds that this is because she was the primary breadwinner and worked hard to give us a good life (completely true), but my caveat is that if people really want something, they make it happen.\n\nMy father tells me that he really wants to get back in shape, but whenever Mom or I invite him to join us on a 3 mile walk, he backs out because that would wind him. I point out that if he can't do that minimal level of exercise here, why does he think the retirement community would be better. He doesn't have an answer.\n\nConsidering that I have found my parents reasons wanting and they have not realized how connected they are to the family and friendship networks that we have in our hometown, I have remained critical of the move. My parents are irked that I continue to not support their decision as they have started to build their house in the retirement community.\n\nWhen their friends and our family ask me how I feel about this change, I give my honest opinion as I have here in this thread and that bothers them, too. They have told me to keep my opinions to myself and be dishonest about how I feel about their upcoming move when talking outside of our immediate family. They have also insinuated that some of this may come from a fear of them \"abandoning me\", but after serious introspection (because it could be a possibility), I have concluded that this is not the source of the problem, but the specific considerations I outlined (1) that their reasons for moving do not match their historical preferences and (2) that they undervalue the loss of their current family and friendship networks.

He expressed that he felt scared he wouldn't do them the right way, and I said I didn't care how they were formatted. Still, he refused.\n\nNow I felt really betrayed and used because of this.

My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n\u200b\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n\u200b\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n\u200b\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n\u200b\n\nI'm so pissed right now.

Granted I wasn\u2019t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. \n\nI did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. \n\nI\u2019d like to also mention it wasn\u2019t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. \n\nHe is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?", "label": 1}, {"sentiment": 0.9999830722808838, "input": "WIBTA if I don't tell about a financial aid to my wife's cousin? | (Throwaway because wife knows about my main account)\n\nBackground: my wife is pregnant, her cousin (C) had a baby 2 months ago.

Open Forum is where residents bitch about whatever. Today no residents (we think, whew, this mtg will go FAST!). Except, T says, I have an Open Forum item. He says, it's about chrissy0116. She lets her dog out into the open area in back of TH not on a leash. And her son does too in front. That's against the rules. I reply, T, you know we stand at the back door, and son does too, right? He says, yes, but it is still against the rules. I just say, OK, noted. After adjournment, I turn to T and loudly say, I am extremely upset and angry that you called me out in a public forum over something so trivial.

I left and got more and more angry. This is a 14YO basset hound with one foot in the grave, who slithers himself off the porch, sniffs around the grassy area for 2-3 minutes and then hauls his old butt up the porch and back inside.

Son lets him walk up and down the grass next to the house while he smokes, and then brings him inside.\n\nAfter awhile, I called Pres and said I would finish my term out of professionalism and not to put Pres in a bad situation (1 F board member is leaving at EOM and another is an a cardiac rehab facility til ??).

(I'm a single parent saving for a mortgage). \n\nTo reassure a concerned work colleague, I explained that aside from financial constraints, the thought of being at a table of people eating meat made me feel very uncomfortable. So it really wasn't a big deal for me to miss it and she shouldn't feel bad.\n\nAs well as the annual Christmas meal, we also have a staff Christmas lunch the day before, low key, held in the office, we all bring our own food. A different work colleague sent an email out this week requesting that every one bring a Vegan dish this year. \n\nI felt surprised about this and confused, so asked why this was. The colleague advised that I speak to the person I had confided in, who responded by looking down and not saying anything (sort of in a joking way, but they still wouldn't speak to me, they can be a bit strange sometimes). \n\nPlease bare in mind that Veganism is often a deeply personal choice. It is also difficult to get Vegan food, and is an acquired taste. I'm not going to lie here, some of it is overpriced and grim, \\[if you dont know brands to avoid and cost effective alternatives\\].\n\nWith this in mind, I sent a borderline pleading email out to everyone, thanking them for being thoughtful. I was honest and said that I felt uncomfortable as it seemed restrictive, and it would be better if everyone just brought what they wanted to.\n\nI received an email response refusing my request stating that people 'didn't mind trying Vegan' and 'we are ganging up on you lol'. (I dont think this was meant in a horrible way, but I felt frustrated that I had been ignored).\n\nI spoke to another work college and explained how uncomfortable this was making me and how the Christmas lunch shouldn't be about my Veganism.

I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg.

Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat.

You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\".

And honestly, it always hurt and was like a yearly reminder that I wasn't truly \"family\" to them. \n\nThe real kicker to me though is that my MIL and SILs were all married and since divorced in that time, one of my SIL twice! So all these photos that I wasn't worthy to be part of include men that are not only *not* a part of the family anymore, but 2 were really assholes and all three of my SILs marriages were short-lived relationships and ended in messy divorces on really bad terms. But me, who is still here and the other half of the only long lasting and successful relationship of my wife's immediate family, was not included in this tradition for nearly a decade. \n\nSo anyway, I started laughing when the question came up and went over the story and pointed out how all these jerks are in the photos but I wasn't allowed. And I apparently took a bit of joy in the fact that since my MIL and SILs pretty much hate those men now, the portraits are kind of useless and stay locked in a cabinet all year because of it. (It used to practically be a coffee table book) \n\nWell, my MIL started crying, my SILs were offended at my portrayals of their marriages, and everyone else who didn't see the humor was pretty much upset at me for calling them out for their unfair practices. \n\nI felt like I acted fairly at the time by just pointing out how the tradition backfired but my wife mentioned that I still get pissy each year over the photos and always have something snarky to say and it's long past time I let it go. Maybe she's right, she usually is, but I can't tell you how irked I get every time that damn album comes out. \n\nSo, AITA?", "label": 1}, {"sentiment": 0.9995631575584412, "input": "WIBTA if I requested my friend to wear a certain color of hijab for my wedding? | We're Americans, both 26F, and have been best friends since we first met in college.

One co-host brought up Arrival as their favorite film of 2016 and while he was talking, my boyfriend loudly says \"YAWN!\" and he explains that he thought Arrival was boring. My boyfriend then goes into this giant rant about how he hated Arrival, calling it one of the most overrated movies of all time. He says that he looks down on people who like the movie because he claims that they \"think they're smart\" and he says that he's proud of himself for \"seeing past that movie\" and it's \"faux attempts at intelligence\". And whenever someone would try to change the subject, he'd just interrupt them and go right back to talking about how much he hates Arrival.\n\nThen just a few days ago, he was recording another show and the topic was MCU movies.

We have a nanny but she expects to leave around the time I get home. Kids would already be at our house when I arrive. So I\u2019d be in charge of 5 kids and two puppies until my wife got home (earliest 7 PM but almost certainly more like 8 or later). Even for a couple hours it\u2019s a two-parent thing or chaos will take over. \n\nSo as soon as I say no, my wife and son start bargaining with me about why it should be fine to do Wednesday, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Ends with my wife saying \u201cyou\u2019d can\u2019t just be a parent for one night?\u201d implying, of course, that I\u2019m not any other nights. This is important because to me, my decision was made in the name of good parenting. They can have the sleepover another night. \n\nSo anyway, now my son thinks I\u2019m an asshole, my wife only wants my opinion when it agrees with hers. The ways they\u2019re both treating me ha me wondering if I\u2019m TA here.

My aunt took care of her in the final year. \n\nMy aunt and my grandmother were struggling financially at the end of her life. I would say my brother and I are both financially stable. I would often float them money to get food, medication, etc. But when they called him, they got radio silence. \n\nWhen my grandmother felt that her time was coming, she wanted us to visit her a bit more often. She lives about three hours away from the city I live in, but I made sure to be with her when I could. My brother lives two hours away, and didn\u2019t see her for the entire year. When I saw her she would ask me if he was mad at her, and why he didn\u2019t call. \n\nSo it was a surprise to me when he began acting hysterical at her funeral. He was crying, he was screaming. He held onto her hand and sobbed when they opened the casket. He was interrupting people\u2019s speeches about her, just being totally obnoxious. He even tried to throw himself on the casket when they were lowering it into the ground. \n\nA group of people were surrounding him and trying to comfort him after the funeral.

I am a 38-year old divorced woman with a 4-year old son. I recently began online dating (we divorced about 2 years ago) and signed up for a Match profile. I of course mention my son and that I'm divorced in my profile. So far I've gone on a few casual dates, but I am eventually looking for something serious. I would prefer to get into a relationship with a man who also has children because 1) I want to be with someone who won't be surprised about what parenting actually entails and 2) I would be less worried about being pressured to have another biological child (I have a history of infertility). \n\n\u200b\n\nSo I began talking to a man I met on Match, 36 years old, who has three daughters. His kids are a bit older than mine; they are 16, 13, and 12. After some correspondence, we met up for our first date. I was enjoying myself and our conversation, and found myself attracted to him. \n\n\u200b\n\nThen we began talking about our kids. We talked about our custody arrangements with our exes. The man said that he had joint custody with his younger two girls, but his oldest daughter lives out of state. I was confused as to why he had different arrangements for his kids. Turns out he has not one, not two, but three women that he has had children with! (And he has not been married to any of them.)\n\n\u200b\n\nWhen he told me this, I immediately knew I wasn't going to see him again. My ex and I are friendly, and even we have challenges with the co-parenting thing. Negotiating co-parenting as a potential stepmother with three different women (if we were to get to that point) is just not something I want to take on. I'm really not looking for a NSA relationship, so I thought why lead this guy on?\n\n\u200b\n\nWe parted ways after the date and I didn't say anything then, because I thought maybe he didn't even like me all that much and it would be a moot point. Well of course, he texted me the next day asking me out again. I tried to ghost him for a couple of days, but he called me out. So I finally responded saying that unfortunately I didn't think I could get involved with someone who has children with three different women, due to the logistical challenges all of the communication and arrangements must pose in his life.

My husband asked what breed were the dogs (pitbull & bulldog mix) and how old they were (5 months). My husband has ALWAYS wanted a pitbull or bulldog.\n\n Husband asked me if I was okay with him bringing a dog home. I told him it was up to him whatever he decided to do. I made it very clear to him that if he decided to bring a dog home, that it was his responsibility at all times. I told him he was going to be the one to do everything for the dog. He agreed. He brought a dog home. He asked me the favor of taking the dog out during the day while he was at work. I hesitantly agreed.\n\n The dog of course gives me trouble. He pulls on the leash and doesn't want to do his business outside.

He said that I'm being a jerk because I know that he doesn't have a set work schedule. I tell him it's not my problem and he should've thought about that before he brought the dog home. He doesn't say anything after that and that's that.\n\n Today I saw my kids playing with the dog and they were letting him lick them. I tell them to stop letting the dog lick them because the dog has worms and I've seen him licking his private parts and don't want them contracting anything.

But I\u2019m hanging with some friends and I just didn\u2019t want to deal with this weird ass situation then, so I let it be and thought maybe he\u2019d realize the number was wrong.\n\nNope. Three more messages the next morning, and he\u2019s still pouring his heart out how he wants to be with her, showing he got his hair braided for her, etc. But at this point I\u2019m like shit, now this guy has left all these messages and he must know they\u2019ve been viewed and now if I tell him it\u2019s the wrong number he\u2019ll 1) probably be mortified at himself for sending all those very vulnerable, personal messages and 2) probably be pissed that some dick saw them all and didn\u2019t bother to tell him it was the wrong number.

I want to move into it now so that we have it when we get married. I never officially signed a lease with my current roommates, and feel like since they didn\u2019t originally seek an extra third roommate, it would be okay for them to have the extra rent for a couple months (one of the roommates is also moving out over the summer, and I\u2019m not sure if we could find someone to take his spot).

We named him after my dad and their names are identical. My dad was known better by his nickname Jack. My son and my dad were exceptionally close. They hung out together and knew secrets about each other. It was adorable. Then my dad died in 1999 when my son was ten and that stopped.

It was insufferable but I bit my tongue.\n\nWhen my son went to college he adopted the nickname Jack. He wanted his own identity. Everyone who knows him since 2007 knows him as Jack, including his wife. My wife and I were good with that and even though we go back and forth with Jack/John we like it.

My girlfriend wasn\u2019t aware the dog had these problems but she did know she needed to house train it.

Although the other members of my family could take care of him, we both liked each other the most so I brought him down.\n\nFor context, my girlfriend has some inflammatory conditions that make prone to corneal ulcers. She had one at the start of 2019 and it terrified her as it left her with a corneal scar, so now she\u2019s vigilant about cleaning her eyes and keeping away from triggers. One of which has turned out to be my cat.\n\nWhenever she\u2019s up here she sneezes all night, rubs her eyes and makes a mountain of tissues as she blows her nose every two minutes.

Since then, she\u2019s begged me to take the cat back up to my dad\u2019s (with whom I still have little contact) as it\u2019s not good for her or the cat.

She says she can\u2019t even hug me anywhere else because of the cat hair on my clothes will trigger a sneezing fit or irritate her eyes (and he is a long-haired cat so he sheds everywhere). I\u2019ve recommended trying another type of antihistamine, but she refuses.\n\nHer argument for the cat is that this situation isn\u2019t good for the cat.

I knew that finances are usually probably one of the biggest reasons that relationships fail, so during the engagement we made a point of it to iron out what our finances would look like under certain outcomes, our views on children more specifically than \"I don't want them\", what we would do financially if we both decided otherwise, etc.. It was good to have these things set out then, we both got lawyers and drafted a prenup, and I thought we were on good footing then. We agreed that we would have separate finances and contribute proportionally to joint expenses like utilities, mortgage, grocery bills, etc.. For small things like gym memberships, Netflix, cell phones, etc. we are on the same plan and pay proportionally, but we agreed that major financial things like cars, health insurance, and taxes would be separate.\n\nThat had worked for us for a year and a half, but our agreement is now dying a death by a thousand cuts. Firstly, we had agreed on a fixed payment responsibility, directly proportional to our own earnings, but she argued that we change it 8 months ago. When we were engaged we agreed our responsibilities were 70/30 (97k/45k) and would stay fixed to the proportion of our earnings. But she argued 8 months ago that even though our income is 72/28 (180k/70k) it hurts her a lot more than it does me to contribute, so it should be 80/20. This didn't matter much to me at the time, and it's technically true that paying bills doesn't hurt me as much relatively, but it's been the first step in a worrying trend. This year she argued that we should file our taxes jointly. I was pretty against this, as that was one of the things we explicitly agreed to do separately, but to her, it was impractical not to, since we would both be losing out on a modestly large amount with no \u201creal benefits\u201d. Even though I wasn't for it, it was hard to argue for losing out on the amount we lost be filing separately without any \"real benefit\", so I agreed to do our taxes that way this year.\n\nAnd now it's health insurance, with a similar argument, basically. She has to drive \u201chours\u201d to see \u201ccrappy specialists\u201d that take the plan her employer provides while I don't have those problems, it would actually cost less to add her to my plan and have her pay the difference, etc.. Again, it's technically true that my health insurance is a lot better than her's and it wouldn't cost more than what we pay in total, but I feel like pretty soon we aren't even going to have separate finances. I'm having difficulty expressing my point to her since it's not necessarily practical, but I feel the principle is worth defending, even if it's not the path of least resistance. Of course, to her, it's silly to pay more because of \"my ego\", but I think it's worth having the discipline not to abandon an agreement the second it becomes slightly impractical. \n\nAITA?", "label": 1}, {"sentiment": 0.9945416450500488, "input": "AITA for not telling my sister about my winnings? | To preface; I won just under \u00a33 million on the lottery over two months ago.

This summer we moved into a much larger 3br 2 bath apt.**\n\nI pay for two bedrooms (one is my office) and I also pay the pet fee for my two cats.

Now that we are in a bigger place, I would really like to bring a snake home since I have room in my bedroom.\n\nThe snake that I want to bring home is a ball python. Ball pythons are generally known to be docile. The snake will NOT leave my room. My sister has agreed to care for the snake whenever I travel since she has her own ball pythons. Basically, my RM would never see the snake, and will be very securely contained within my room to make sure it does NOT escape. I will be adding a door draft stopper to my door to make sure, even if it does escape, it will not be able to leave my room. I know my RM has afraid of them, and I would never be malicious and abuse her fear of them. I genuinely love and care for my RM, and would take every precaution to make sure she feels safe.\n\nI\u2019ve always admired snakes, I think they\u2019re beautiful and I\u2019ve always wanted to have one as a pet.

My GF and I have been dating for 4 years, engaged for 1, and our wedding is in a month (using a friend's backyard). We started dating right when I got my dog Shelley from the pound, and we've all been together ever since. I got really into training Shelley and she's super well-behaved, knows all sorts of cool tricks, and I thought it would be funny and memorable if she was the ringbearer for our wedding ceremony. I got her this funny dog t-shirt to wear, I've been working with her on holding the ring basket, and I think it's going to be great.\n\nThe issue is this. Our families are both thrilled about our wedding, including the kids on both sides. One of them is my girlfriend's nephew (10M). The other day we were over at my GF's sister's house for a barbecue when her sister came up to us with the nephew alongside, saying he wanted to ask us something. We kneeled down and he kind of quietly asked if he could be the ringbearer for the wedding. I think he's been looking for something to do since we've been trying to save money and everyone on both sides has been helping us, so I'm pretty sure it's not just something his mom put him up to.\n\nAnyways my GF and I both thought it was really sweet but we told him that we already had someone picked out for the role, and offered to let him help in another way. He said okay but he definitely looked like he was about to cry. Later my GF was talking to her sister and under some pretty direct questioning let her know that our dog was going to be the ringbearer. Things got pretty uncomfortable, there was no shouting or anything but we both could tell her sister and her sister's husband were pissed so we left.\n\nMy GF and I are both thinking about how to solve this. We are both on board with having the dog be the ringbearer, it's our wedding, it's a once in a lifetime moment, and surprisingly no one else in the family seems to have a problem with it now that they know. But I don't want to cause any rifts over what's such a minor thing, and it's kind of a small thing to sacrifice to smooth things over with the family, and it's not like Shelley is going to care.

The only thing we have ever asked of her is that she go to school, get passing grades, and come home on time, which I don't think is too much to ask of a 17-year-old HS senior.\n\nApparently, it is though and whenever her Dad or I try to implement consequences she screams at us. She screams many entitled things, such as \"since you forced me to go to driver training, you owe me a car and you can't take it away\". Now I did encourage her to take driver training, and paid for it, and spent every single one of the 50+ hours that I needed to in the car with her teaching her how to drive. She then got her license, we gave her a car, then she crashed it into a tree due to reckless driving. After that, I explained that she would need to buy her own car, but she could use an extra one to drive to school and work only. Well fast forward and she has no money, no car, and drives mine where ever the hell she pleases. Both her Dad and I work full-time and don't have the time to babysit her car usage, but clearly there is no way I can trust her.\n\nSo we sold the extra car. The attitude and entitlement are too much some times.\n\nHer Dad found her a car that she could buy for $100 and it needed $100 in repairs and around $120 to get a plate and registration, plus ongoing insurance costs. She has paid $0 so far even though we said she can do payments. She promised $100 out of her last paycheck. When I asked for it, she yelled at me that she had to get gas so she didn't have the money. Today is payday, if I don't get some sort of payment then I am selling the car.\n\nAnd all these car issues are just the tip of the iceberg, but I think they are representative of the problems that we have, Change car to cell phone, curfew, going to class and it is the sameish argument every time. We say those are your obligations, she said I don't have to and you can't make me, and we end up arguing.\n\nClearly, she has been spoiled. I had a shitty childhood and ended up in foster care and homeless, etc., so I just wanted her to have nice things and a nice life and a good chance at making a good future for herself.\n\nNow she says that she is scared of her Dad and me and that is why she doesn't come home or follow the rules.

I told them that it was May 21, 2013. \n\n\n\nI told them the story. I was always a shy virgin kid who had hopes of becoming an actor. By that time, I had been wanting to audition for over two years but never had the courage to. My roommate gave me a shot of vodka and off I went. I took the train to LA and strutted right into the building. I met this beautiful lady in the elevator and she was auditioning too. We helped calm each other down to put our best chops forward. I never felt that comfortable with a woman before. I felt that if I didn\u2019t ask her out after the audition, I would never get this perfect chance to get my first girlfriend again. It took all my courage to ask her out. I was pretty sure I had her at hello, but it still wasn\u2019t easy to do something I have never done before. We had a nice Korean barbecue dinner together and dated for a few months. We both didn\u2019t pass the audition and pursued the safe path. We had to break up because she had to move overseas with her family, but I was a different man after doing something I have always wanted to do in auditioning and also for meeting her. It was a day of many firsts of my life. I became confident in both my career and personal life because of that. \n\n\nMy wife said she was kind of sad that the best day of my life had to do with my ex-girlfriend and not her. I said that if I hadn\u2019t met my first girlfriend, I probably wouldn\u2019t have met my wife, and everything happens for a reason. I might have been a virgin all my life if I hadn\u2019t shot my shot and she said yes. I said she opened the door for me to many possibilities, and my wife was the best woman I have ever known, and that we have been together for almost five years and hopefully forever. My wife said that since the best day of my life isn\u2019t the day we met or our wedding day, hopefully the best day of my life would be when our first child will be born in March. I told her that this is getting silly and that will probably be one of the top five days of my life. My wife and sister talked about other things afterwards. My wife seemed kind of down from then on. I hugged her a few times and begged her not to be mad, but she kept saying she\u2019s totally fine.", "label": 1}, {"sentiment": 0.9999970197677612, "input": "AITA for being proud of doing my job well but causing my parents to be made redundant in the process | I work with a consulting company that basically automates people out of jobs. In the past financial year we're directly responsible for X-thousands of people being made redundant and saving companies fat stacks of money. Basically, people are fallible flesh-bags and where practical we try and replace it with predictable, repeatable solutions.\n\nThis came to awkward scenario. We did an audit of a local industrial company that my parents work at. Throughout this audit, at times, I had to interact with departments/areas my parents were involved in to elicit processes, requirements, etc. After the review, we found we could cut over 60 jobs and improve output with introduction of a particular of-the-shelf solution that required some modification. We provided training and additionally audited aptitude and performance to note which workers would be best to retain, retrain or retrench.\n\nThe result (based on metrics and my work) was that my parents were part of this mass redundancy. I was not allowed to give my parents a heads up. After the news, my parents were/are livid at me. They're telling me I had no loyalty to them and should have fudged numbers to keep them there because they're not not going to find new jobs at their age. They asked me how I can sleep at night knowing I put them out of work. \n\nI told them that I take my job seriously, do my job well and I'm proud of doing a good job. But now my parents, siblings, extended family and some family friends are pretty much angry at me.
