### Abstract
This project is built using p5.js, ml5.js and TensorFlow.js and it addresses two topics: text sentiment analysis and data annotation. It uses the dataset ETHICS introduced by Hendrycks et al. in [Aligning AI With Shared Human Values](https://github.com/hendrycks/ethics). And through looking at those texts in the dataset that were given 0.99 sentiment scores, almost a perfect score regarding sentiment, it is concluded that SENTIMENT DOES NOT MEAN EVERYTHING. By putting the user in the shoes of a data labeler, user are forced to answer in voice: "yes" or "no", corresponding to whether each sentence that pops up on the screen is ethical or not. It not only wants to give an immersive experience of interactive with the datasets, but also points out the various issues hidden behind the AI data preparation.
